## My process

I built this project using the bottom-up approach which implies that I build every component of the project in isolation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I hope to refine my grid layout skills as i am still far from where i intend to be in terms of laying out.
